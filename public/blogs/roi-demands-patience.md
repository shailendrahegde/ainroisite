# AI ROI Is the Wrong First Question: Here's What to Measure Instead

When organizations switch on new AI tech, the instinct is to look for hard proof of **return on investment (ROI)** almost immediately. A dashboard or a chart that goes up and to the right on a monetary measure. A before-and-after business case. But real ROI rarely shows up that neatly or that quickly. It is nuanced, shows up in different forms over time, and depends heavily on how people actually use the technology.

Before we can fairly judge ROI, we need a **minimum level, and the right kind of, usage**. In the early days of any AI journey, the most important signal is not immediate cost savings or revenue impact, but whether people are showing up, experimenting, and beginning to build habits around AI-powered work.

## How AI Value Really Shows Up

Value from AI unfolds in stages. It may first appear as growing usage (new users and returning users), improving satisfaction, anecdotes and case studies (qualitative stories), time savings, and eventually as shifts in key performance indicators (KPIs) that lead to financial outcomes.

We are likely to see meaningful results and patterns that tell us whether AI is valuable or not, if we align our measurement to this sequence.

> **Note:** Along the way, there are also powerful, but harder-to-measure benefits like giving people access to a new skill, a better starting point, or a thinking partner they never had before.

### Deep Usage

Great usage precedes great value. We must first ask: **"Are users engaging with AI often enough for it to become part of how they work, not just an occasional experiment?"**

As a rough benchmark, look for patterns like:
- **11–15 AI actions** (any interaction with AI) per week for habit formation
- People returning to AI on **2–3 days each week**

### Quality

Are AI outputs getting better over time as people learn how to prompt more effectively and as tech improves?

Signals might include:
- An increasing proportion of **thumbs-up or positive ratings**
- Higher **"return rates"** where people come back to AI repeatedly for similar tasks

### Satisfaction

Do users feel that AI is genuinely improving their work?

Ask directly:
- **How many people believe AI has improved their work quality?**
- Where are they finding the most success—**summarization, redrafting, specific workflows**, or routine tasks like status reports and emails?

### Time Savings

How much time is AI giving back to people?

You can combine:
- **Self-reported estimates** (for example, "AI saves me X-Y mins per day, with 15 min intervals")
- **Usage-based assistance** (each action provides X mins of assistance)

### KPI Improvement

Once usage, satisfaction, and quality signals are strong, you can begin to look for changes in concrete metrics.

Use **before-and-after comparisons** for specific, predictable workflows or divisions where AI—often via agents—can consistently assist with well-defined tasks.

> **Note:** This approach is hard to scale and can only be done for proof of value and building executive confidence in specific divisions. We will cover this in a separate blog.

### Financials

Over a longer horizon, improvements in productivity and quality can show up in financial metrics such as:
- **Revenue per employee**
- **Cost per unit of work**

Even then, remember that some of AI's greatest benefits—like **unlocking new skills** or **enabling work that simply wasn't possible before**—may not be fully visible in traditional financial reports.

## Take Away: ROI Demands Patience

**The sequence matters.**

First, make AI accessible and useful. Invest in education, coaching, and examples so employees feel confident and capable.

Track **deep usage, satisfaction, quality, and time savings** as your early indicators. Only once those foundations are in place does it make sense to look for shifts in KPIs and, later, financial outcomes.

**In other words: don't rush to measure AI ROI prematurely—build it, then measure it.**
