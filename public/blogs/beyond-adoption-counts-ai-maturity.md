# Beyond Adoption Counts: Three Dimensions That Reveal Real AI Maturity

## TL;DR

**The problem:** Most organizations still measure AI progress with blunt metrics—license counts, active users, total actions. These tell you *volume*, but not whether AI is genuinely changing how work gets done.

**The solution:** Measure three dimensions—not just one. **Volume & Consistency** (is usage sustained?), **Complexity** (is usage getting more sophisticated?), and **Breadth of Adoption** (is it spreading across the organization?). Together, they capture the behavioral signature of a genuinely AI-mature organization.

**The impact:** Organizations that track all three dimensions can distinguish surface-level activity from real transformation—and know exactly where to intervene.

## The Problem With Counting Actions

When leadership asks "how is our AI rollout going?", the default answer is usually a number: active users, total prompts, or actions per week. These metrics are necessary—but they are dangerously incomplete.

Counting actions is like measuring fitness by steps walked. Steps matter, but they don't tell you whether someone is getting stronger, more flexible, or building endurance. A person walking 10,000 aimless steps and someone completing a structured training program might log similar numbers—but only one is actually getting fitter.

The same is true for AI adoption. An organization where 500 people each ask their AI assistant one simple question a week looks identical, on an active-user chart, to one where 500 people are using AI across multiple surfaces, delegating to agents, and building repeatable workflows. The activity count is the same. The organizational capability is not.

The idea of AI maturity—organizations that integrate AI deeply into how work gets done, combining human judgment with AI assistants and agents at scale—is compelling. But translating that vision into something measurable requires going beyond adoption counts.

## Three Dimensions That Actually Matter

A more complete picture requires three complementary dimensions. Each captures a different aspect of what it means to be making real progress.

### 1. Volume & Consistency — "Is usage sustained?"

This is the dimension most organizations already track, but often incompletely. Volume alone is not enough—*consistency* is what separates experimentation from habit.

The key metrics here are:

- **Intensity**: Actions per user per week—are people using AI enough to get value?
- **Frequency**: What percentage of eligible weeks is each user active? Someone who uses AI intensely for two weeks then disappears is not forming a habit.
- **Retention**: Are users coming back week over week, month over month? Cohort retention curves tell you whether AI is sticky or a novelty.
- **Power user share**: What percentage of your population qualifies as a power or habitual user? This is the sharpest signal of durable adoption.

A practical benchmark: users who cross roughly 11–15 AI actions per week tend to shift from erratic experimentation to stable, habitual use. Tracking the share of users above that threshold—and how quickly new cohorts reach it—is one of the strongest indicators of Volume & Consistency progress.

### 2. Complexity — "Is usage getting more sophisticated?"

This is the dimension most organizations *don't* track—and it's the one that separates a genuinely AI-mature organization from one that just happens to have a lot of licenses.

Early AI adoption is typically narrow and assistive: people summarize meetings, draft short emails, or ask simple questions. That's fine as a starting point. But organizations making real progress show a different pattern—usage that expands across surfaces, features, and agent-supported workflows.

What to measure:

- **Breadth per user**: How many different features or apps is each person using? A user who only summarizes meetings is getting value, but a user who also drafts documents, analyzes data, and delegates to agents is operating at a fundamentally different level.
- **Agent adoption and intensity**: Are people moving beyond AI-as-assistant to AI-as-collaborator? Agent usage—number of agents used, interactions per user, return rates—captures the shift from Pattern 1 (human with assistant) to Pattern 2 (human-agent teams).
- **Agent breadth**: How many *different* agents is each user interacting with? This signals whether people are exploring AI's capabilities or stuck in a single narrow use case.

The progression matters: organizations typically move from AI as a personal assistant (summarize this, draft that) to AI as a team member (agents handling specific steps in a workflow, with humans directing and reviewing). The Complexity dimension captures where you are on that journey.

### 3. Breadth of Adoption — "Is it spreading?"

AI maturity is not defined by a small group of expert users. It is defined by AI becoming a shared organizational capability—used across roles, teams, and functions.

This is where many organizations stall. They have enthusiastic superusers (often 5–10% of the population) generating disproportionate usage, while the remaining 80–90% are inactive or barely engaged. The overall numbers might look fine because superusers pull up the averages—but the organizational capability is fragile and concentrated.

Key metrics:

- **Enablement**: What percentage of the organization has access? Are there teams or functions where AI assistants, chat, or agents are blocked by IT policy—sometimes without leadership even knowing?
- **Adoption by function**: What percentage of each team, department, or region has active users? Spotting which groups lag reveals where enablement, use cases, or permissions need attention.
- **Distribution equality**: Is usage spread across the org chart, or concentrated in a few teams? A Gini-style view of adoption across groups quickly shows whether you have broad capability or pockets of excellence surrounded by inactivity.

One pattern we see repeatedly: analytics reveal a team with near-zero AI usage, and the initial assumption is "they don't see the value." Investigation reveals that transcription, web grounding, or another prerequisite was disabled for that group. The blocker was infrastructure, not motivation.

## How the Three Dimensions Connect

These dimensions are not independent—they reinforce each other:

- **Volume & Consistency** without **Complexity** means people are using AI a lot, but only for simple tasks. They've built a habit, but it's a narrow one.
- **Complexity** without **Volume & Consistency** means people are doing sophisticated things with AI, but sporadically. They know *how* to use it well, but it hasn't become part of how they work every day.
- **Volume & Consistency** plus **Complexity** without **Breadth** means you have a small group of highly capable AI users—and everyone else is watching from the sidelines.

A genuinely AI-mature organization shows strength across all three. That's the behavioral signature: sustained, sophisticated, and widespread.

## A Simple Self-Assessment

You don't need a sophisticated dashboard to start. Ask three questions:

| Dimension | Question | Red flag |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Volume & Consistency** | What share of our licensed users are active in any given week—and is that share growing? | Active user percentage is flat or declining after the first 90 days |
| **Complexity** | Are users expanding beyond one or two surfaces, and is agent usage emerging? | 80%+ of actions are in a single app; agent adoption is near zero |
| **Breadth of Adoption** | How many teams have meaningful adoption, vs. how many have near-zero activity? | More than half of teams/functions have <10% active users |

Whichever dimension scores weakest is where your next enablement investment should focus. Trying to improve all three at once dilutes effort. Pick the constraint, address it, then move to the next.

## Putting It Into Practice

If you want to move beyond a self-assessment and into real measurement, the open-source [AI-in-One Dashboard](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-in-One-Dashboard) was designed to do exactly this. It consolidates AI assistant usage, chat activity, and agent adoption into a single Power BI view—covering usage trends, habit formation, license prioritization, and leaderboards across all three dimensions described above. It's free, customizable, and built to help leaders move from anecdotal impressions to data-driven adoption decisions.

## Bottom Line: Measure the Shape, Not Just the Size

AI adoption is not a single number. It has a shape—and the shape tells you whether you are building real AI maturity or just accumulating activity.

Track whether usage is **sustained**, whether it's getting **more sophisticated**, and whether it's **spreading broadly**. That three-dimensional view is what separates organizations that are genuinely transforming how work gets done from those that are simply reporting adoption metrics to a steering committee.

The tools, the data, and the frameworks exist—and projects like the [AI-in-One Dashboard](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-in-One-Dashboard) make it practical to start today. The question is whether your measurement approach is keeping up with your ambition.
