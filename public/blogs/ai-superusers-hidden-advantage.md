# AI Superusers: The Hidden Advantage in Your Organization

## TL;DR

**The reality:** AI adoption follows a power law—5-10% of users generate disproportionate value through significantly higher usage intensity and deeper engagement.

**The opportunity:** Your organization already has superusers. The competitive advantage comes from finding them, learning from their patterns, and scaling what works.

**The impact:** Superusers create network effects through osmosis—their visible habits spread informally, accelerating adoption faster than any centralized training program.

## The Power Law of AI Adoption

AI adoption rarely spreads evenly inside an enterprise. Instead, it follows a power-law curve: a small fraction of employees generates a disproportionate share of usage—often 5–10× more than the remaining 80%. These employees are your AI superusers.

Superusers matter because they have solved the hardest part of AI adoption: making AI genuinely useful within the real constraints of your organization—its processes, compliance requirements, tools, and culture. The opportunity for IT and business leaders is straightforward but often overlooked: every organization already has superusers. The competitive advantage comes from finding them, learning from them, and scaling what works.

## What Makes AI Superusers Different?

### 1. Higher Action Intensity—Early and Persistent

Superusers pull ahead quickly. In the first one to two months, when the company average might be ~8 AI interactions per week, superusers average ~35-40. When the average climbs to ~20, they are often at ~80. This gap persists until usage eventually plateaus around ~100–120 actions per week, a natural saturation point. The specific tasks that drive this peak are still an area of active study—but the pattern is remarkably consistent.

### 2. Depth Before Breadth

Superusers master a small number of "surfaces" first—such as chat or collaboration surface like meetings—where AI fits naturally into their daily work. They build fluency and muscle memory before expanding into adjacent workflows. Average users tend to spread their usage thinly across many tools and struggle to reach the same depth of usage.

### 3. Sticky Habits

Superusage is not episodic. Once users experience clear, repeatable value, they keep building. In our data, movement from the superuser tier back down is extremely rare. The inverse is also true: low usage tends to be sticky as well, which makes early intervention critical.

### 4. Reinforced by Leadership Role-Modeling

Superusers are disproportionately found in teams where managers—and managers of managers—are visible AI users themselves. This is not accidental. Leaders who demonstrate adoption through behavior, not just strategy and message posts, send a powerful signal: AI use is permitted, important, and urgent.

### 5. Often Earlier-Career Employees

While superusers exist at every level, many organizations see higher concentrations among more junior employees. Curiosity, fewer entrenched workflows, and a willingness to experiment often outweigh seniority as predictors of rapid adoption. If you are piloting with limited licenses, assume diversity of role—not hierarchy—matters most.

## Why Superusers Create Outsized Value

Superusers typically have significantly larger internal and external networks than median users—often ~50% larger. They are curious, ambitious, and embedded in cross-functional work. When they adopt AI, they gain disproportionate leverage.

Because they are well connected, their habits spread through everyday exposure. Colleagues see what works, borrow prompts, and adopt workflows informally. This "osmosis effect" creates a powerful network multiplier that no centralized training program can match.

## How Leaders Can Use Superusers to Drive AI Adoption

### 1. Identify and Support AI Champions

Many organizations formalize superusers into an AI Champions program. Champions share practical examples, host lightweight show-and-tell sessions, and reduce trial-and-error for others. The key is credibility: champions should be practitioners (identified through analytics), not evangelists detached from real work.

### 2. Make Success Visible and Transferable

Recognition is a signal. Share specific use cases, prompts, and before-and-after workflows so others can replicate success. Visibility accelerates learning far more than abstract best-practice documents.

### 3. Use Superusers to Shape Onboarding

Superusers rarely need onboarding; they are self-directed. Capture what they do and convert it into templates, quick-start guides, and internal playbooks. This is one of the fastest ways to move the median user up the curve.

## Can Superusers Be Cultivated?

Yes—but only intentionally. The fastest way to accelerate adoption is to study what your existing superusers do well and replicate those conditions across teams. Usage analytics are absolutely important, but they are not always sufficient. Surveys and focus groups add critical qualitative context and often reveal hidden blockers.

In one organization, superusers existed almost exclusively in a single division. Analytics showed heavy usage of meeting summarization and web-grounded chat, while other teams showed negligible activity. The reason was simple and discovered through conversations: transcription and web grounding were disabled elsewhere.

In another company, superusers clustered in Operations, driven by heavy use of free-form chat to build citizen-led automations for routine processes. That signal directly informed the decision to expand licensing in that division.

## Bottom Line: Amplify What Already Works

The takeaway for IT and business leaders is clear: you do not need to guess where AI value lies. Your superusers are already showing you—through behavior, not opinions. Study them, remove friction, and scale their patterns. In the race to realize AI ROI, the fastest path forward is not inventing the future—it is amplifying what already works.
