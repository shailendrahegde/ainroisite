# Who Gets AI Licenses First? Five Allocation Models Compared

Rolling out an AI tool across an organization quickly turns into a practical (and sometimes political) question: how many licenses should we buy, and who should get them first? The answer matters, because early allocation shapes adoption, learning, and the stories people tell about whether the investment "worked."

We've seen customers experiment with several license allocation models. Each has strengths—and each has tradeoffs worth naming upfront.

## 1) Lottery/Random allocation

What it is: Randomly distribute licenses across the organization.

- **Why teams choose it:** It feels fair, easy and avoids intentional bias.
- **Where it breaks down:** It ignores existing work habits and real demand signals, and it often creates friction for enablement and training. Instead of training one function or a few teams together, this will need highly curated content, coordination across many roles, geographies, and managers which increases overhead. It also suffers from a lack of critical mass where the entire team or roles are upskilling together. Lack of peers to learn from within their own team means new habits are not seen as normal and you don't get the 'show me how you did that' moments.

## 2) Survey-based allocation

What it is: Ask employees to request a license and describe how they plan to use AI.

- **Why teams choose it:** It captures early demand signals and encourages people to think through use cases. It also benefits from self-selection: the most motivated employees tend to raise their hand.
- **Where it breaks down:** Surveys are easy to miss and hard to evaluate at scale. More importantly, intent often diverges from reality—what people think they'll do with AI rarely matches day-to-day usage once friction appears. Surveys with descriptive content "how do you plan to use AI" introduce review overhead and subjective decision-making.

## 3) Demographic or attribute-based allocation

What it is: Allocate licenses based on attributes like role, tenure, department, or function.

- **Why teams choose it:** This is relatively low lift as allocation can be done via HRIS and org data. It's also easier to measure ROI or benefits as you can see how KPIs change within certain groups. It also has the added benefit of governance – policies can be tailored to groups and roles. When done thoughtfully, it can accelerate learning. For example, we've seen faster uptake among employees earlier in their tenure, and stronger adoption when licenses are concentrated in a specific division or in roles with clear, repeatable workflows.
- **Where it breaks down:** This approach can introduce bias and create a sense of exclusion. It may send signals that AI is not for us which can lead to lasting adoption drag. Homogeneous cohorts also limit cross-functional learning, which is often where the most novel use cases emerge.

## 4) Usage-based allocation

What it is: Prioritize people who already show strong usage signals—either from a free tier of the AI product or from heavy usage of core productivity apps (docs, spreadsheets, email) where AI can create leverage.

- **Why teams choose it:** It can shorten the enablement curve. If someone is already hitting habit-forming activity thresholds, you're more likely to see immediate utilization of paid licenses. It also scales very well – as soon as you have licensed the first tranche, you have a clear set of users that are ready for the next batch. Overall, this leads to better returns as the product utilization remains high.
- **Where it breaks down:** Not all "usage" is equal. AI usage for quick web search is different from AI usage that changes how someone writes, analyzes, or ships deliverables (for example: document summarization, drafting, or data synthesis). It can also incentivize shallow usage to earn licenses.

## 5) Behavior-based allocation

What it is: Allocate licenses to "likely superusers" based on behavior signals—people with high network connectivity, high collaboration hours, and lots of cross-team interactions.

- **Why teams choose it:** These employees often figure out how to apply AI quickly to make work better and faster, and they can act as internal champions. These users are force multipliers as they often become translators turning AI tips into repeatable practices. It's also great for change management as you have already recruited users who can normalize the new behavior. It's also useful when you don't have existing usage telemetry.
- **Where it breaks down:** Behavioral signals can be noisy and role-dependent. Sales and program roles naturally collaborate more than engineering or research, which can reintroduce bias. These users also still require enablement—habits alone do not guarantee depth. Additionally, not all AI platforms offer actionable behavior telemetry.

## Some Guiding Principles for AI License Allocation Decisions

The goal is not to find the perfect model upfront. It is to create a learning system. The strongest programs follow a few consistent principles:

1. **Concentrate licenses before you spread them.**
   Depth beats breadth early. Teams learn faster when peers adopt together and reinforce new habits. Choose representative roles from multiple departments and concentrate licenses around those roles to build depth and cohorts.

2. **Use usage signals, not just intent.**
   Observed behavior is a stronger predictor of value than survey responses or stated plans.

3. **Avoid simultaneous multiple AI explorations.**
   Any AI tool needs some degree of enablement. Expecting usage to take off without enablement is aspirational at best. This is easier when you have one single AI system to train on vs. multiple.

4. **Optimize for learning velocity, not optics.**
   Fairness matters—but early AI programs succeed when they maximize organizational learning, not equal distribution, or hierarchical distribution.

AI license allocation is one of the earliest—and most consequential—decisions IT leaders make. Get it right, and adoption compounds and accelerates. Get it wrong, and even strong technology struggles to recover.
