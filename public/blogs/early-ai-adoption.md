# What Early AI Adoption Really Looks Like in the Enterprise

## The Reality: A Power-Law of AI Usage

In almost every organization, AI usage quickly settles into a power-law distribution. A small group of superusers drive a disproportionately high number of interactions, while most employees sit in a long tail of light or experimental use. These superusers matter, but if you lead IT or digital transformation, you also need to understand what "healthy" early adoption looks like across the broader population.

## First 90–120 Days: What Good Engagement Looks Like

In the first three to four months after rolling out an AI solution, we typically see average weekly interactions in the 7–10 range per active user. That means a user is prompting, refining responses, or accepting AI-generated suggestions 7–10 times a week.

During this phase, two surfaces usually dominate:
- **Meeting platforms** (automated notes, summaries, and actions)
- **General-purpose chat** (Q&A, drafting, quick analysis)

This is both normal and desirable. These experiences deliver clear value, require almost no training, and match existing user behavior. Getting a quick answer, finding a doc or enterprise knowledge, and accessing meeting notes without attending a 60-minute call are intuitive, low-friction wins that are essential for habit formation.

## Months 4–6: Expanding Surfaces and Confidence

As users gain familiarity and confidence, adoption grows along two dimensions. First, interactions on the initial, high-traffic surfaces continue to increase. Second, people begin to experiment with AI inside creator tools such as email, documents, and spreadsheets. Design tools tend to ramp more slowly as they demand new ways of working.

A key indicator to track at this stage is the number of apps or surfaces per active user. By around month six, a healthy pattern is for the average user to be using AI consistently in three to four surfaces, not just in meetings and chat.

## What IT Leaders Should Do

If you are responsible for driving AI adoption, your early strategy should be about habit formation at scale, not chasing niche use cases. Start by making AI indispensable in one or two high-traffic, familiar experiences: meeting platforms and general-purpose chat. Make it easy to turn on, easy to try, and easy to see value within a week. Ensure that AI is able work well and isn't blocked on technicalities like access to recordings or web-grounding.

Once those habits are in place and you see sustained interaction levels, focus on higher-value, specialized scenarios in email, documents, spreadsheets, and eventually design tools. At that point, your goal shifts from proving AI's value to broadening where that value shows up—moving from a few superusers to a durable, organization-wide capability.
