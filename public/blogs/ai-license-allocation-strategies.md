# How to Roll Out AI Licenses: Big Bang, Drip Feed, or Learn-and-Scale?

You've made the investment. Your organization has purchased AI licenses—Copilot or another enterprise AI solution. Now comes the question that will shape your entire rollout: How do you allocate those licenses?

This decision isn't just about logistics. It's about setting the trajectory for AI adoption across your entire organization. After working with dozens of enterprise customers through their AI journeys, we've observed three distinct allocation strategies—each with profound implications for adoption, enablement, and long-term success.

## Strategy 1: Big Bang (Allocate All at Once)

Launch to everyone, all at once. Full organizational coverage from day one.

The promise is compelling: maximize license utilization immediately, create organization-wide momentum, simplify communication with one launch message, and enable network effects across all teams simultaneously.

When it works, it's powerful. But launching is just the starting point—it must be followed by robust enablement. Without the right infrastructure in place, big bang can backfire:

- Poor first impressions stick. If users encounter friction early without proper support, it damages sustained adoption. First experiences matter, and you only get one chance. The danger is that you may not know that certain policy decisions taken many years ago could become blockers (e.g., your policy on call recording).
- Enablement must scale instantly. You need champions identified, training content ready, support channels active, and communication infrastructure (SharePoint sites, Yammer communities, help desks) operational before launch.
- Support teams get overwhelmed. A flood of questions, edge cases, and technical issues hit simultaneously.

Best for organizations with mature change management capabilities, strong executive sponsorship, and robust enablement infrastructure already in place.

## Strategy 2: Drip Feed (Gradual Allocation Over Months)

Allocate small batches, learn, adjust, and repeat. Some organizations take 8+ months to fully allocate their licenses.

The promise: retain optionality when evaluating competing AI solutions, generate fresh waves of excitement with each new cohort, and create pent-up demand that converts into immediate power users.

We've observed interesting patterns with this approach. Each launch phase creates a new wave of enthusiasm and identifies new superusers. There's something powerful about "getting access" that generates organic excitement.

But the downsides are significant:

- Your metrics will look perpetually disappointing. Every new cohort brings down aggregate averages for key metrics (actions per user, days active). Without sophisticated cohort-based reporting, leadership sees declining or stagnant numbers—even when earlier cohorts are thriving.
- Enablement fatigue is real. Change teams face repeated launch cycles, each with fresh challenges, new training sessions, and ongoing communication cadences.
- Adoption velocity suffers. Overall, we've observed slower adoption rates with drip-feed strategies compared to other approaches.

The one valid use case: If you're genuinely evaluating multiple AI platforms and want to preserve flexibility before committing fully, drip-feeding makes strategic sense. Otherwise, the costs typically outweigh the benefits.

## Strategy 3: Learn and Scale (10-90 Model)

Start with 10% of your organization. Learn deliberately. Then launch to the remaining 90% all at once.

The approach is straightforward:

1. Phase 1 (10%): Allocate licenses to a targeted initial cohort
2. Learn intensively: Conduct user interviews, identify friction points, document what works
3. Make adjustments: Update policies, refine training, fix infrastructure gaps, develop FAQs from real user questions
4. Phase 2 (90%): Launch broadly with confidence, armed with insights and proven enablement playbooks

### Why This Often Works Best

You learn before scaling. Real user feedback shapes your enablement strategy before the majority of your organization experiences the tool.

You build proof points. Early success stories and use cases become powerful ammunition for broader rollout.

You avoid the "everyone's a guinea pig" problem. The 90% get a refined, proven experience—not a beta test.

You contain risk. If something isn't working, you discover it at 10% scale, not 100%.

Champions ready: The first 10% when selected carefully, create enough champions to drive momentum for the remaining 90%.

### The Critical Success Factors

**Who gets the first 10% matters enormously.** Choose strategically: include champions, those that are influential, with large networks, known interest in new technology. Include leaders who will vocally advocate for AI use.

**Concentration matters for network effects.** A dispersed 10% dilutes learning and collaboration. Consider concentrating licenses within specific teams or departments to enable peer learning and knowledge sharing, team-based use cases and workflows, and visible success within concentrated areas.

**Deliberate learning is non-negotiable.** The 10% phase isn't just a soft launch—it's an intensive learning period. Invest in structured user interviews, usage analytics review, rapid iteration on blockers, and documentation of learnings.

The tradeoffs: you temporarily suppress network effects by limiting initial access, the first 10% selection can create perceptions of favoritism, and you delay full license utilization by several weeks or months.

## So, Which Strategy Should You Choose?

Choose Big Bang if you have proven change management muscle and enablement infrastructure, executive sponsorship is rock-solid, you can support organization-wide launch from day one, and you've piloted with a small group already and ironed out major issues.

Choose Drip Feed if you're genuinely evaluating multiple AI platforms, have very limited enablement resources, or your organization culture favors gradual change.

Choose Learn and Scale (10-90) if this is your first major AI rollout, you want to balance speed with learning, you can dedicate resources to intensive learning during the initial phase, and you're willing to be strategic about the initial 10% selection.

## The Bottom Line

There's no universally "right" answer—but there is a right answer for your organization.

What we've learned from enterprise AI rollouts: the allocation strategy you choose shapes early success and adoption outcomes as much as the technology itself.

Don't let license allocation be an afterthought. Make it a strategic decision.
