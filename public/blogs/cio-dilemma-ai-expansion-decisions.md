# The CIO's Dilemma: How to Make AI Expansion Decisions Before the Outcomes Arrive

AI purchases are now among the largest and most consequential technology investments CIOs and CTOs will ever make. For many enterprises, the first enterprise wide AI platform purchase is the biggest check they've ever written for software—and the pressure to "get it right" is immense.

Most organizations start small: a pilot cohort, a few thousand licenses, a limited rollout. But the real decision comes later—the expansion. Moving from a tactical trial to a strategic, enterprise wide commitment is a much bigger leap. And that leap must be justified long before the long-term ROI can actually materialize.

This is the paradox investment committees face today:

Making a multi million dollar decision about AI before the data that justifies that decision even exists.

So how do organizations navigate this?

Let's break down what investment committees need, why traditional ROI projections fall short, and a more trusted way to demonstrate that AI is truly taking root.

## Why Early-Stage AI Decisions Are Harder Than They Look

When evaluating whether to expand an AI deployment, CIOs look for confidence in three areas:

### 1. Risk Mitigation: "Is this safe?"

Large enterprises overwhelmingly prefer proven players. Trusted vendors, strong governance models, and secure architectures reduce decision friction. Most of the market leaders already meet this bar.

### 2. Technical Fit: "Will this work in my stack?"

This is largely about integration maturity. Leading AI players invest heavily to plug into existing workflows—productivity suites, security layers, identity, orchestration. For most CIOs, the differentiation here is narrowing.

### 3. Returns: "Can I justify this to my CFO and the board?"

This is the hard part. Because real value that translates into top line and bottom line change takes time. For AI to meaningfully embed into workflows—sales, finance, operations, support—it requires a minimum of 8–12 months. Behavioral change, skill-building, and business process infusion simply don't happen fast enough to hit the expansion decision window. Yet CIOs need answers within 3–5 months of the initial purchase.

So what happens?

They turn to projection models—spreadsheets, TCO calculators, promise-heavy business value decks. And while these tools help frame the story, they rely on stacked assumptions of number of users, frequency of usage, value per use, multiplied across the entire org. Executives know this game and many are skeptical.

So the real question becomes:

What evidence can you show when you don't yet have end-to-end business outcomes?

## The Answer: Show Trajectory and Behavioral Proof

When time is limited, the most credible signals don't come from projections—they come from observed behavior and the direction of the curve.

Three types evidence matter the most.

## 1. The Velocity of Habit Formation

Instead of asking, "Is AI delivering value yet?"

CIOs should ask, "Are people forming habits with AI?"

Key signals include:

- **Habit threshold attainment** - How many users are returning every week?
- **Growth rate** - How quickly is the pool of habitual users expanding?
- **Sustained engagement** - Are users coming back over consecutive weeks?

These indicators don't require 12 months of maturity. They show, within weeks, whether AI is "landing" in the organization.

If habit formation is rising, value will follow.

## 2. What "Great" Looks Like Today (Your Top 10%)

Every organization already has high engagement AI superusers. The top 10% reveal what the future can look like at scale.

Three metrics matter: frequency, intensity, and breadth.

Why focus on them?

They are living proof points of what full-value AI adoption looks like—today, not in a hypothetical future.

For investment committees that do demand value narration in dollar terms, you can generate conservative productivity estimates by multiplying their interactions or sessions by simple constants of hourly salary and time savings per interaction. The point isn't precise accounting—it's illustrating the order of magnitude difference between average and peak usage.

That contrast is powerful because it reveals how much latent value remains unlocked.

## 3. AI diffusion in use cases

Instead of waiting 6-12 months to see if AI adds value, look whether AI is being used within business processes.

Even early on, you can see:

- AI usage inside work apps (spreadsheets, documents, meetings)
- Complex actions (formula generation, data restructuring, formatting automation)
- Emerging skills employees didn't have before
- Survey anecdotes showing new confidence ("I can now build something I never knew how to do")

One familiar critique at this stage is that usage does not guarantee value. This is true—but no usage guarantees no value.

Workflow infusion is the earliest reliable proxy that value is on the way.

## How to Package All This Into a Business Case

A compelling, board-ready AI expansion case should have four chapters:

### 1. How Adoption Is Progressing Today

- Number of users above the habit threshold
- Growth rate of habitual users

### 2. What "Great" Looks Like (North Star Benchmark)

- Frequency, intensity, and app-diversity metrics for the top 10%
- An illustration of the gap between median and superuser productivity
- Conservative estimates of value per interaction or per session

This shows both the realized value and the potential value.

### 3. What People Are Actually Doing With AI

- Survey anecdotes
- Focus group themes
- Examples of new skills unlocked
- Early workflow infusion signals

These stories humanize the data and make the future feel tangible.

### 4. The Investment Ask

- How many licenses you intend to procure
- Why these users (e.g., free-tier users who already exceed habit thresholds)
- Range of estimated productivity returns based on real observed behavior today

This frames the decision as scaling what is already working—not betting on projections.

## Closing Thought

Investment committee isn't looking for perfection; they're looking for confidence.

In the early stages of AI rollout, trajectory and behavior provide that confidence far more reliably than spreadsheet-based projections.

If the usage curve is rising, if habit formation is accelerating, and if your top 10% are already exhibiting high-value patterns, then the question is no longer "Should we expand?"

It becomes:

"How do we reduce the time to high value patterns for the entire company?"
